# DTS demo browser

The [original code](https://github.com/chartes/dts-demo/) for this application was developed by [Julien Pilla](https://github.com/mrgecko) (Ã‰cole Nationale des Chartes), and further adapted by [Matteo Romanello](https://github.com/mromanello) (UniL) to work as a generic DTS browser.
